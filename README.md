# Generative Recommenders

Repository hosting code for ``Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations`` (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152, to appear in ICML'24).

Currently only code for reproducing public experiments listed in the paper (Section 4.1.1) are included. We plan to release custom kernels for HSTU needed for throughput/performance benchmarks at a later point in time.

## Getting started

### Public experiments

To reproduce the public experiments (traditional sequential recommender setting, Section 4.1.1) on MovieLens and Amazon Reviews in the paper, please follow these steps:

#### Install dependencies.

Install PyTorch based on official instructions. Then,

```
pip3 install gin-config absl-py scikit-learn scipy matplotlib numpy apex hypothesis pandas fbgemm_gpu iopath
```

#### Download and preprocess data.

```
mkdir -p tmp/ && python3 preprocess_public_data.py
```

#### Run model training.

A GPU with 24GB or more HBM should work for most datasets.

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train.py --gin_config_file=configs/ml-1m/hstu-sampled-softmax-n128-large-final.gin --master_port=12345
```

Other configurations are included in configs/ml-1m, configs/ml-20m, and configs/amzn-books to make reproducing these experiments easier.

#### Verify results.

By default we write experimental logs to exps/. We can launch tensorboard with something like the following:

```
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/ml-1m-l200/ --port 24001 --bind_all
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/ml-20m-l200/ --port 24001 --bind_all
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/amzn-books-l50/ --port 24001 --bind_all
```

With the provided configuration (.gin) files, you should be able to reproduce the following results (verified as of 04/15/2024):

for all three tables above, the ``SASRec`` rows are based on [Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09781) but with the original binary cross entropy loss
replaced with sampled softmax losses proposed in [Revisiting Neural Retrieval on Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04039). These rows are reproducible with ``configs/*/sasrec-*-final.gin``.
The ``BERT4Rec`` and ``GRU4Rec`` rows are based on results reported by [Turning Dross Into Gold Loss: is BERT4Rec really better than SASRec?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07602) -
note that the comparison slightly favors these two, due to them using full negatives whereas the other rows used 128/512 sampled negatives. The ``HSTU`` and ``HSTU-large`` rows are based on [Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152); in particular, HSTU rows utilize identical configurations as SASRec. ``HSTU`` and ``HSTU-large`` results can be reproduced with ``configs/*/hstu-*-final.gin``.
