# Generative Recommenders

Repository hosting code for ``Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations`` ([ICML'24 paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/zhai24a.html)) and related code, where we demonstrate that the ubiquitously used classical deep learning recommendation paradigm (DLRMs) can be reformulated as a generative modeling problem (Generative Recommenders or GRs) to overcome known compute scaling bottlenecks, propose efficient algorithms such as HSTU and M-FALCON to accelerate training and inference for large-scale sequential models by 10x-1000x, and demonstrate scaling law for the first-time in deployed, billion-user scale recommendation systems.

## Getting started

We recommend using `requirements.txt`. This has been tested with Ubuntu 22.04, CUDA 12.4, and Python 3.10.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can manually install PyTorch based on official instructions. Then,

```bash
pip3 install gin-config pandas fbgemm_gpu torchrec tensorboard
```

## Experiments

### Public Experiments

To reproduce the public experiments in our paper (traditional sequential recommender setting, Section 4.1.1) on MovieLens and Amazon Reviews in the paper, please follow these steps:

#### Download and preprocess data.

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/ && python3 preprocess_public_data.py
```

A GPU with 24GB or more HBM should work for most datasets.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 main.py --gin_config_file=configs/ml-1m/hstu-sampled-softmax-n128-large-final.gin --master_port=12345
```

Other configurations are included in configs/ml-1m, configs/ml-20m, and configs/amzn-books to make reproducing these experiments easier.

#### Verify results.

By default we write experimental logs to exps/. We can launch tensorboard with something like the following:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/ml-1m-l200/ --port 24001 --bind_all
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/ml-20m-l200/ --port 24001 --bind_all
tensorboard --logdir ~/generative-recommenders/exps/amzn-books-l50/ --port 24001 --bind_all
```

With the provided configuration (.gin) files, you should be able to reproduce the following results (verified as of 04/15/2024):

for all three tables above, the ``SASRec`` rows are based on [Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09781) but with the original binary cross entropy loss
replaced with sampled softmax losses proposed in [Revisiting Neural Retrieval on Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04039). These rows are reproducible with ``configs/*/sasrec-*-final.gin``.
The ``BERT4Rec`` and ``GRU4Rec`` rows are based on results reported by [Turning Dross Into Gold Loss: is BERT4Rec really better than SASRec?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07602) -
note that the comparison slightly favors these two, due to them using full negatives whereas the other rows used 128/512 sampled negatives. The ``HSTU`` and ``HSTU-large`` rows are based on [Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17152); in particular, HSTU rows utilize identical configurations as SASRec. ``HSTU`` and ``HSTU-large`` results can be reproduced with ``configs/*/hstu-*-final.gin``.

### Synthetic Dataset / MovieLens-3B

We support generating synthetic dataset with fractal expansion introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08910. This allows us to expand the current 20 million real-world ratings in ML-20M to 3 billion.

To download the pre-generated synthetic dataset:

```bash
pip3 install gdown
mkdir -p tmp/ && cd tmp/
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-jZ6k0el7e7PyFnwqMLfqUTRh_Qdumt-
unzip ml-3b.zip && rm ml-3b.zip
```

To generate the synthetic dataset on your own:

```bash
python3 run_fractal_expansion.py --input-csv-file tmp/ml-20m/ratings.csv --write-dataset True --output-prefix tmp/ml-3b/
```

### Efficiency experiments

``ops/triton`` contains triton kernels needed for efficiency experiments. ``ops/cpp`` contains efficient CUDA kernels. In particular, ``ops/cpp/hstu_attention`` contains the attention implementation based on [FlashAttention V3](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) with state-of-the-art efficiency on H100 GPUs.

## DLRM-v3

We have created a DLRM model using HSTU and have developed benchmarks for both training and inference to faciliate production RecSys use cases.

#### Run model training with 4 GPUs

```bash
LOCAL_WORLD_SIZE=4 WORLD_SIZE=4 python3 generative_recommenders/dlrm_v3/train/train_ranker.py --dataset debug --mode train
```

#### Run model inference with 4 GPUs

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mlcommons/inference.git mlperf_inference
cd mlperf_inference/loadgen
CFLAGS="-std=c++14 -O3" python -m pip install .

LOCAL_WORLD_SIZE=4 WORLD_SIZE=4 python3 generative_recommenders/dlrm_v3/inference/main.py --dataset debug
