    Interface enabling interfacing with various similarity functions.

    While the discussions in our initial ICML'24 paper are based on inner products
    for simplicity, we provide this interface (SimilarityModule) to support various
    learned similarities at the retrieval stage, such as MLPs, Factorization Machines
    (FMs), and Mixture-of-Logits (MoL), which we discussed in
    - Revisiting Neural Retrieval on Accelerators (KDD'23), and
    - Retrieval with Learned Similarities (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15462).
